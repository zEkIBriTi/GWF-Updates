<p>Tanzaniaâ€™s livestock population has been increasing by 5% per anum. Its 21.3 million large herd of cattle makes it the largest in southern Africa. However, on the downside, 97% of all animals are kept by smallholders who are often faced with poor productivity and yield. Mwanza region has the highest livestock density in the country and the third largest total herd of all regions. The increased meat production for intra and inter-regional consumption, hides and skins for domestic and export must have high priority. Mwanza Region is endowed with good quality pasture land (287,319Ha) with a livestock population distributed vis 1.3 million cattle, 500,000 goats, and 150,000 sheep. This presents an excellent opportunity for the establishment of Commercial Ranches and Livestock Multiplication Units (LMU). Specifically in Mabuku (62 Km from Mwanza City) in Misungwi District, there is about 10,000 Ha of land with a cattle capacity of 6,000 livestock.</p>
