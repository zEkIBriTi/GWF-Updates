<p>The agriculture sector, as a whole in Tanzania has an annual growth rate of 6% and accounts for nearly half the GDP contribution, 70% of the rural household income, and absorbs 80% of the entire workforce. (TIC Investment Profile 2013-14). Suffice it to say that agriculture is the main investment opportunity in Mwanza region. The Government has introduced a specialist agricultural revolution initiative namely Kilimo Kwanza which has opened up infinite investment opportunities for interested parties.Additionally, several reforms have been undertaken in this sector such as a review of land laws to allow for long term leases for foreign companies and redefining the role of government and private sector that allow for the latter to participate in production, processing, and public support functions. Mwanza has enormous water resources potential; with 53.25% of its area being lake Victoria. Water for irrigation can be obtained from the lake and from the river basins that feed into the lake.Potential land under irrigation in Mwanza is approximately 39411 hectares of which only 1,429 (3.93%) hectares are under irrigation farming at present . This provides for high agricultural investment opportunities such as importing modern and efficient farming equipment, providing training on modern farming techniques eg. appropriate use of irrigation technology, and &nbsp;initiation of modernized irrigation farming projects.</p>
